Open FractionsGUI.py in an IDE and run the file.

A window will pop up and ask a question.

First, confirm the common denominator by putting your 
answer on the sensor and pressing the button. It is
recommended to put the fraction as close to the sensor 
as possible to get an accurate reading.

If the denominator is incorrect, the app will tell the 
user to try again. If it is correct, the app will ask the
user to confirm the answer to the question.

Confirm the answer like before. Make sure that the answer 
is in an unreduced form. For example, 1/4 + 1/4 would be
2/4 in this step instead of 1/2.

If the numerator is greater than 1, the the fraction will
need to be scanned multiple times. For example, if you
think the answer is 4/8, then the 1/8 fraction will need
to be scanned 4 times.

If an incorrect fraction is scanned at any point, or if 
the sensor doesn't detect the fraction properly, the 
app will tell the user to try again and the user will
have to start over.

If the answer can be reduced, the app will ask the user to
give the answer in reduced form. For example, if the 
answer was 4/10 in the previous step, then the answer in
this step would be 2/5. Confirm the answer the same way 
as in the previous step. Once the correct answer is 
given, the app will ask a new question.

If the answer in the second step can't be reduced any 
further (for example, if the answer was 2/3), the app will
skip the reducing step and ask a new question.
